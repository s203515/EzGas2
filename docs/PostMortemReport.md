Consider the EZGas project and provide your thoughts after completing it. 
Distinguish between what you could not change (requirements, tools, timing, team selection, etc) 
and what was under your control (team organization, available skills, communication tools, etc).
Also this document will not be used for evaluations, but for improving the project approach for the coming year.


# Best things

 - The small-size **EZgas** project was a great opportunity to put into practice the **software engineering** concepts learnt during the course. 

- The **CATME** application used to create and to evaluate the groups is a good way to simulate what  actually happens in companies.

- Define the **requirements** of a **software product** is a key activity. We have created our requirement document before working on a ready-to-use model proposed by the professor. This was necessary to provide the same starting point to all groups.

- Different kind of **tools** was used:

     - communication: Slack, Telegram, Zoom
     - configuration management: git 
     - project: Eclipse, maven
     - testing: JUnit, Eclemma, Mockito, SikuliX, Jackson
     - framework: Spring Boot
     
- Timing. It was very important to respect different **deadlines**.

- **Skills**. Each member of our group tried to apply all the activities. We did not use specialization even if sometimes it was necessary to respect deadlines. Each of us has acquired new skills.

- **People**. The project gives the opportunity to improve  the communication with  teammates and to learn more about ourselves. 

Weâ€™re proud of our team.

# Worst things

This was and will be remembered as a *strage* year because of the **COVID-19** virus.  It was mandatory to stay at home and therefore we were unable to meet fisically at university. This is the worst thing that could happen. 

We think that everyone did the best effort to face the problem, even if it was not always easy, neither for us as students nor for professor and his assistents. We have obviously understood the difficulty of managing such an event from the teaching point of view.

On the other hand, we had different kind of tools thanks to which it was possible to communicate and to create virtual meetings when necessary. 

Our group did not detect any negative thing.

# Suggestions 

- Deal with a project is the best way to practice the software engineering discipline. 

- The course is well structured.

- It would be interesting, as an option, to create a project  from scratch and replace the final exam with a complete discussion on the project. In this case it should be necessary to develop and mantain the whole project.
